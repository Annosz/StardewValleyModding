# Cheaper Beach Bridge Repair

See [this link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5826) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod uses Harmony to make a prefix for clicking on the bridge and selecting the repair option on the dialog panel, overwriting the method with my implementation which requires less wood.

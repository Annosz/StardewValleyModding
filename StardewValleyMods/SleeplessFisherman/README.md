# Sleepless Fisherman

See [this link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5915) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod uses Harmony to create a prefix that surpasses the sleep emote if the player is currently fishing.
